           <h1 id="sat1">Saturn:The Ringed Gas Giant</h1>
        <main>
           <p class="sat">Saturn is the second-largest planet in our solar system after Jupiter. It’s classified as a gas giant and is mostly made of hydrogen and helium. This planet is better known for its ammount of rings around it and its large number of moons that orbit it.
           
            </p>
            <h2 id="sat2">A Brief Description</h2>
        <p class="sat">Saturn is mostly made of hydrogen and helium, the same two main components that make up the Sun.Saturn is blanketed with clouds that appear as faint stripes, jet streams, and storms. The planet is many different shades of yellow, brown, and gray.The rings that orbit Saturn are made of billions of small chunks of ice and rock coated with other materials such as dust. The ring particles mostly range from tiny, dust-sized icy grains to chunks as big as a house. A few particles are as large as mountains. Interestingly, each ring orbits at a different speed around the planet.These rings span up to 282,000 km (175,000 miles) wide but are incredibly thin, only about 10 meters (33 feet) thick in most areas.</p>
        <h2 id="sat2">Size</h2>
        <p class="sat">Its diameter is about 120,536 km (74,898 miles), which is roughly 9.5 times that of Earth.</p>
        <h2 id="sat2">Atmosphere-Temperatures</h2>
         <p class="sat">As a gas giant, Saturn doesn’t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling gases and liquids deeper down. While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Saturn, it wouldn’t be able to fly through unscathed either. The extreme pressures and temperatures deep inside the planet would crush, melt, and vaporize any spacecraft trying to fly into the planet.Winds in the upper atmosphere reach 1,600 feet per second (500 meters per second) in the equatorial region.Saturn's north pole has an interesting atmospheric feature – a six-sided jet stream,with a massive, rotating storm at the center.

     <p class="sat">Saturns' temperature is different at it's center and at it's atmosphere</p>
     <ul class="satul">
        <li>It's core may reach temperatures of about 15,000 degrees Fahrenheit(8315°C)</li>
        <li>At Saturns' atmosphere, you can expect temperatures of about -312 degrees Fahrenheit(-191.11°C).</li>
        </ul>
     <h2 id="sat2">Exploration History</h2>
    
    <h3 id="sat3">Pioneer 11 (1979)</h3>
     <p class="sat">
        Pioneer 11 was the first spacecraft to fly past Saturn.

      <h3 id="sat3" > Discoveries:</h3>
        <ul class="satul">
       <li>Provided the first close-up images of Saturn and its rings. </li>
     <li>Discovered two new moons and mapped the planet's magnetic field.</li>
     <li>Measured the temperature of Titan, one of Saturns' many moons, but couldn’t penetrate its thick atmosphere. </li>

     </ul>
    </p>
    <h3 id="sat3">Voyager 1-2 (1980-1981)</h3>
<p class="sat">
    Achievements:
   <ul class="satul"> 
   <li>confirmed that Titan’s atmosphere is mostly nitrogen. </li>
  <li>Revealed complex structures in the rings, including "spokes" and "braiding."</li>
 <li>Observed the intricate dynamics of the moons and their interactions with the rings. </li>
 <li>Provided further details on the planet's atmosphere and weather patterns.</li>
 <li>Captured clearer images of the outer moons and ring structures.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3 id="sat3">Cassini-Huygens Mission(1997–2017)</h3>
<p class="sat">A joint mission by NASA, ESA (European Space Agency), and ASI (Italian Space Agency).</p>
<p class="sat">Discoveries</p>
<ul class="satul">
    <li>Captured detailed images of Saturn’s rings, showing their dynamic and ever-changing nature.</li>
    <li>Discovered several new moons, including tiny, icy objects within the rings.</li>
    <li>Explored Titan,providing images and data about Titan’s lakes, rivers, and dense atmosphere.</li>
    <li>Discovered geysers of water vapor and organic molecules erupting from the moon Enceladus, indicating a subsurface ocean that could harbor life.</li>
</ul>

    <h2 id="sat2">Fun Facts!</h2>
    <ul class="satul">
        <li>Some of Saturn’s moons, like Pandora and Prometheus, are called "shepherd moons" because they help keep the planet's rings in place through gravitational forces.</li>
        <li>Saturn emits radio waves that have been captured and converted into eerie "sounds" by spacecraft.</li>
        <li> Saturn's rings aren't permanent! They’re slowly disappearing as the material falls into the planet due to gravity and radiation. Scientists estimate the rings may vanish in about 100 million years.</li>
    </ul>
