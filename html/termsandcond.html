        <h1>Terms and Conditions for Participation in the Lunar Excursion Mission (LEM)</h1>
        <p>By purchasing or accepting a ticket for the Lunar Excursion Mission ("Mission"), you ("Participant") agree to comply with the following Terms and Conditions. These rules are legally binding, non-negotiable, and essential for ensuring the safety, order, and, in some cases, the survival of all participants.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1.Mission Overview</li>
            <li>1.1. The Lunar Excursion Mission is a one-way ticket to an unparalleled experience. The Moon awaits your arrival, but returning to Earth is not guaranteed.</li>
            <li>1.2. This Mission is experimental in nature, with an undisclosed success rate. Participant acknowledges that test flights may have encountered “anomalies.”</li>
            <li>1.3. By participating, you are deemed fit for space travel and accept all associated risks, including, but not limited to:

                Loss of gravity-induced bone density
                Exposure to cosmic radiation
                Unanticipated extraterrestrial encounters.
            </li>
            <li>2. Psychological Preparedness</li>
            <li>2.1. Participants must undergo mandatory psychological evaluations. Any signs of paranoia, fear of isolation, or inability to follow orders will result in immediate disqualification without refund.</li>
            <li>2.2. Participants may experience:

                Lunar hallucinations ("Moon Madness") due to prolonged exposure to the desolate lunar environment.
                Existential dread caused by witnessing Earth as a distant, fragile sphere.
            </li>
            <li>2.3. In the event that you hear voices during your mission, you must notify Mission Control immediately. Ignoring this may result in catastrophic consequences.</li>
            <li>3. Liability and Acknowledgment of Risks</li>
            <li>3.1. The Participant acknowledges the following risks, which may include but are not limited to:

                Catastrophic spacecraft failure during liftoff, lunar landing, or Earth return.
                Unidentified anomalies on the Moon, including unexplored craters, unexplained shadows, and mechanical malfunctions.
                Unexpected encounters with non-human entities.
            </li>
            <li>3.2. The Organizer accepts no liability for:
                Mental trauma resulting from isolation, darkness, or unexplainable phenomena.
                Disappearance of crew members under unknown circumstances.
                Time dilation effects that may cause Participant to return to Earth several decades later.
                </li>
            <li>4. Code of Conduct</li>
            <li>4.1. All Participants must comply with the following behavioral protocols:

                Do not touch or approach unidentified objects on the Moon. This includes glowing stones, shimmering pools of liquid, or any artifact that appears deliberately placed.
                Avoid entering uncharted craters or structures unless explicitly instructed by Mission Control.
                Under no circumstances should Participants respond to strange radio signals, even if they appear to mimic Mission Control’s frequency.
                </li>
            <li>4.2. Participants found violating the Code of Conduct will be left behind on the Moon. No appeals will be considered.</li>
            <li>5. Communications</li>
            <li>5.1. Lunar communications may be subject to:

                Interference from unexplained lunar phenomena.
                Hijacking of signals by entities of unknown origin.</li>
            <li>5.2. In the event you hear communications in languages or voices not listed in Mission Control's personnel roster, you are to:
                Cease all operations immediately.
                Retreat to the nearest secure zone.
                Await further instructions, assuming communication lines remain uncorrupted.
            </li>
            <li>6. Ownership and Discovery</li>
            <li>6.1. All materials or objects discovered on the Moon, including lunar rocks, relics, or artifacts of potentially alien origin, are the sole property of the Organizer. Participants are forbidden to claim ownership or remove any such items.</li>
            <li>6.2. Participants acknowledge that any biological or psychological changes observed post-mission may be studied for scientific purposes without consent.</li>
            <li>7. Emergency Protocols</li>
            <li>7.1. If a Participant experiences anomalous sensations, such as hearing whispers, feeling compelled to explore unauthorized areas, or sensing unseen presences:
                
                Report immediately to the onboard medic.
                Failure to report such anomalies may lead to irreversible consequences.
            </li>
            <li>7.2. In the event of unexplained crew disappearances, remaining Participants must prioritize self-preservation.</li>
            <li>8. Termination of Mission</li>
            <li>8.1. The Organizer reserves the right to terminate the Mission at any point due to:

                Unforeseen lunar disturbances (e.g., seismic activity, sudden eclipses, or unexplained movement of celestial objects).
                Discovery of sentient lunar beings.
                Any sign of irreparable spacecraft damage.</li>
            <li>8.2. Termination protocols may involve abandoning the mission site and/or self-destructing the spacecraft.</li>
            <li>9. Consent to Surveillance</li>

                Biometric tracking, thermal imaging, and neurological scans.
                Behavioral analysis to detect signs of contamination or external influence.</li>
            <li>9.2. Participants waive all rights to privacy during the Mission. Any attempts to disable monitoring equipment will result in immediate disciplinary action.</li>
            <li>10. Acknowledgment of Finality</li>
            <li>10.1. Participants agree that certain aspects of the Mission, including its true purpose, may remain classified indefinitely.</li>
            <li>10.2. By signing below, you acknowledge that this journey may result in outcomes beyond human understanding and waive the right to pursue legal action against the Organizer for any loss, injury, or irreversible transformations.</li>
            <li>10.3. Survivors of the Mission are required to undergo post-return quarantine for a period of no less than 365 days. Failure to comply will result in permanent relocation to a secure, undisclosed facility.</li>
            <li>11. Secrecy and Confidentiality Agreement</li>
            <li>11.1. Absolute Confidentiality
                Participants are required to maintain complete secrecy regarding all events, discoveries, and phenomena witnessed during the Lunar Excursion Mission. This includes, but is not limited to:
                
                Any anomalies experienced on the Moon.
                Interactions with unexplained entities or objects.
                Classified procedures conducted by Mission Control or onboard personnel.
                Any deviation from the publicly disclosed mission objectives.</li>
            <li>11.2. Prohibited Disclosures
                Participants agree not to discuss, reveal, or publish any information related to the Mission, whether verbally, in writing, or via digital means, to any person, organization, or government without express written permission from the Organizer.</li>
            <li>11.3. Monitoring of Communications
                Participants understand that their personal communications, both during and after the Mission, will be subject to ongoing surveillance to ensure compliance with the confidentiality agreement. Attempts to circumvent this monitoring will result in immediate and irreversible corrective actions.</li>
            <li>12. Enforcement of Confidentiality</li>
            <li>12.1. Lifetime Obligation
                The confidentiality agreement is binding for the Participant's lifetime. Any breach of this agreement will be considered an act of treason against the Organizer and humanity's collective interests.</li>
            <li>12.2. Consequences of Breach
                Participants who violate the confidentiality agreement will be subject to the following measures:
                
                Immediate termination of all benefits and privileges provided by the Organizer.
                Permanent removal from all public records and history as if the Participant never existed.
                Deployment of specialized recovery teams to retrieve any leaked information and neutralize its source.
                Elimination of the Participant through undisclosed means to preserve the integrity of the Mission.</li>
            <li>12.3. Witnessing the Unexplainable
                Participants are advised that certain events, entities, or occurrences witnessed during the Mission may exceed human comprehension. Disclosing such phenomena to the general public may lead to widespread panic, collapse of societal structures, and other catastrophic outcomes. For this reason, the Organizer cannot allow any leakage of sensitive information, under any circumstances.</li>
            <li>13. Memory Suppression Protocol</li>
            <li>13.1. Post-Mission Measures
                Upon returning to Earth, Participants will undergo a mandatory Memory Suppression Protocol designed to erase specific details of the Mission from their consciousness. This is a precautionary measure to ensure:
                
                The Participant's mental well-being.
                The safety of global security.
                Prevention of unintended disclosure under duress or subconscious influence.</li>
            <li>13.2. Side Effects of the Protocol
                The Participant acknowledges that the Memory Suppression Protocol may result in side effects, including but not limited to:
                
                Partial or total amnesia.
                Recurring dreams or nightmares about the Mission.
                Phantom sensations or voices tied to lunar experiences.
                An uncontrollable desire to "return."
                Participants who resist the Memory Suppression Protocol will be detained indefinitely in a secure facility for further evaluation.</li>
            <li>14. A Final Warning</li>
            <li>14.1. Do Not Speak of the Moon
                If the Participant chooses to violate the terms of this agreement despite all warnings, they will trigger the Termination Clause.
                Termination Clause (14.1.1): By breaking this agreement, the Participant forfeits their life, liberty, and identity. Specialized operatives will locate the Participant, and all necessary steps will be taken to ensure compliance.
                Friends, family, and associates of the Participant may also face consequences for harboring information or aiding in its dissemination.</li>
            <li>14.2. A Life in Shadows
                Should the Participant become a threat to the confidentiality of the Mission, they will be placed in permanent exile under a new identity, in a location so remote and untraceable that Earth itself will feel like a distant memory.</li>
            <li>14.3. The Final Words
                The Organizer reminds you: "What happens on the Moon, stays on the Moon." Violating this sacred pact will invite consequences beyond your imagination. We own your silence, and the Moon owns your soul.</li>
