           <h1 id="mer1">Mercury: The "Fastest" Planet</h1>
           <p class="mer">Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest in our solar system, being slightly bigger in size than the Earth's Moon.<br>It was named after the Roman god Mercury, the fastest god, due to the fact that it orbits the sun with a speed of 48 km/s, completing a full rotation around it in 88 Earth days!<br>Mercury has the largest core relative to its size of any planet in the solar system. Its iron core makes up about 85% of the planet's radius, which contributes to its high density.</p>
            <h2 id="mer2">A Brief Description</h2>
        <p class="mer">Mercury's surface resembles that of Earth's Moon, scarred by many impact craters resulting from collisions with meteoroids and comets.Most of Mercury's surface would appear greyish-brown to the human eye. </p>
        <iframe id="merview" src="https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/solar-system/#/mercury?featured=false&logo=false&search=false&shareButton=false&menu=false" allowfullscreen ></iframe>
        <h2 id="mer2">Size</h2>
        
        <p class="mer">With a radius of 2,440 kilometers, Mercury is a little more than 1/3 the width of Earth.</p>
       
        <h2 id="mer2">Atmosphere-Temperatures</h2>
         <p class="mer">   Mercury is one of the few planets that does not have an atmosphere.<br> It's atmosphere is composed of  oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium<br> and it is not strong enough to support weather phenomena because it is simply too thin.</p>
         <h3 id="mer3">Temperature</h3>
     <p class="mer">The temperatures on Mercury are extreme!</p>
     <ul class="merul">
        <li>During the day, temperatures on the surface can reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius).</li>
        <li>Because the planet has no atmosphere to retain that heat, nighttime temperatures on the surface can drop to minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 180 degrees Celsius).</li>
     </ul>
    
     <h2 id="mer2">Exploration History</h2>
    <h3 id="mer3">Mariner 10 (1974-1975)</h3>
     <p class="mer">First Spacecraft to Visit Mercury: Launched by NASA in 1973, Mariner 10 was the first mission to fly by Mercury.
        Flybys: Mariner 10 conducted three flybys, capturing about 45% of Mercury’s surface.
      <h3 id="mer3">  Discoveries:</h3>
        <ul class="merul">
       <li> Mercury has a thin atmosphere (exosphere).</li>
     <li>Confirmed its large iron core.</li>
     <li>   Mapped craters and other surface features for the first time.</li>

     </ul>
    </p>
    <h3 id="mer3">MESSENGER (2004-2015)</h3>
<p class="mer">Launched in 2004, MESSENGER took over six years to reach Mercury, using flybys of Earth, Venus, and Mercury to adjust its trajectory.
    Achievements:
   <ul class="merul">
    <li> Mapped 100% of Mercury’s surface in detail.</li>
   <li> Confirmed the presence of water ice and organic compounds in permanently shadowed craters near Mercury’s poles.</li>
  <li>Provided evidence that Mercury's magnetic field is generated by its molten outer core.</li>
 <li>   Revealed Mercury's surface is rich in sulfur.</li>
    End of Mission: MESSENGER’s mission concluded in 2015 when it deliberately crashed into Mercury’s surface after running out of fuel.</ul>
</p>

    <h2 id="mer2">Fun Facts!</h2>
    <ul class="merul">
        <li>Mercury does not have moons.</li>
        <li>Despite its extreme heat, Mercury has ice in permanently shadowed craters near its poles, where sunlight never reaches.</li>
        <li> At certain points on Mercury's surface, the Sun appears to rise, stop, go backward, and then continue rising. This happens due to Mercury's eccentric (oval-shaped) orbit and slow rotation.</li>
    </ul>
