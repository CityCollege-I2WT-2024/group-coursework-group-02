            <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Hobbies</h2>
            <p data-aos="fade-up">I am not so active person, but from early childhood I was involved in different sports, tennis, swimming, volleyball and so on. I especially loved playing the piano so I spent half of my life learning how to play on this instument. My interest also fell on reading at some point, unfortunately, now due to studies and other activities I don't have that much free time to read, but I still aim to read as much as possible.</p>

            <h2 data-aos="fade-up">About Project</h2>
            <p data-aos="fade-up">This project was something new for me, usually I was more into logical problems, so it was interesting to work with design and layout. This project exposed me to a different side of my speciality, unlocked my potential and brought me together with new people. During this project I had to sometimes step out of my comfort zone and learn how to interact with people, listen to other team members and look for better solutions. I consider this to be an irreplaceable experience.</p>

            <ul data-aos="fade-up">In this project I used such sites as:
                <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a> - an indispensable help wand that could answer almost all my questions.</li>
                <li>StackOverflow - if there was an error in the code, it was eliminated with the help of useful advice from people on this site.</li>
                <li>All photos of planets were taken with the author's permission from the <a href="https://www.nasa.gov">NASA</a> gallery.</li>
                <li>YouTube videos also helped, which helped with site setup and other little things.</li>
