                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi, I am Angel Plloça (some of you will not be able to pronounce my last name) and I was born on the 3rd of February of 2006, in time to be part of the last great generation according to TikTok and Instagram reel videos.</p>
                <p>Since I was a kid, I was fascinated with the way electronics worked to the point where i was thinking that the TV actually had people in it. Like a lot of computer enthusiasts, I dissasembled the first computer I got trying to figure out how everything worked. I was 5 years old. Since then my passion for computers and problem solving challenges has grown. Thus, the decision to study computer science. Also this major is the reason I use the only photo of myself where I kinda look like a serious person.</p>

                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>If I had to list and describe all of the things I enjoy doing it would take me a lot longer than it took me to write the English course essay. Regarding technology wise I enjoy coding, but a bit more, I love doing phone and PC repairs when possible, whether it being software or hardware related. I cannot deny that at times I enjoy the hardware part of things a bit more. </p>
                <p>Before I moved to Thessaloniki I played basketball and went to the gym to maintain a healthy body. Sadly that has been put to a halt due to the lack of time, mostly because of my lack of proper time managment. Instead of doing that I practice my other hobby in my free time of watching movies, mostly mystery movies that involve action such as heists or resolving a crime and even sci-fi.</p>
                <p>I also like to participate in events such as one we had in our city where all of the schools of the city would give a show in our local theater where I also got to be the presenter of the show two years in a row, while also participating in some of it's acts.</p>

                <h2>The Project</h2>
                <p>Regarding the project, for me it was my first big scale project compared to the ones I was used to doing in high-school. It was an amazing experience which lead to new friendships being formed while also enjoying the whole process of bringing to life what was initially just drawn on a blank whiteboard as you can see in the image to the right. I suppose we came very close. </p>
                <p>We worked a lot as a team even though we worked on a lot of individual parts separately. Since the beginning we could not even decide on an actual team leader so every member contributed to the project equally in all aspects from organising meetings to solving problems that came up during the project. </p>
