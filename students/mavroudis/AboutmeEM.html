<h1 id="headers">A Few Words About Me</h1>
<p class="hello">Hello reader of this page,</p>
<img class="me" src="../mavroudis/images/me.webp">
<p class="text"> My name is Evangelos Mavroudis,and I am a 1st Stage Computer Science Department student!</p>

<p id="text">I was  born on May 29 2006 and from a young age I have taken an interest<br> in Computer Science and computers in general(mostly gaming but that's beside the point).I live in a small town near Thessaloniki called Vathylakos.</p>
<p id="text">From a young age, I have watched my father play games on the computer and the ps3,<br> and that made me want my own pc so that I could play games by myself and with friends.<br> Despite my current career in this department,I always liked Biology and anything that had to do with it.<br>
My favorite games include titles such as</p>
<ul id="inp">
    <li> Dragons' Dogma</li>
    <s><li> League of Legends</s></li>
    <li> Skyrim</li>
     <li>Terraria </li>
      <li>Elden Ring </li>
      <li>Subnautica</li>
       <li>Slime Rancher</li> 
        <li>Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning</li>
         <li> Dragon Age: Inquisition and more!</li>
        </ul> 
        <p class="text">I spend most of my free time gaming and talking with my friends.<br> I enjoy RPG games the most, because I love the adventure and the open-world aspect of them.</p>
</p>
<h2  id="headers">A Few More Details</h2>
<img class="picturee" src="../mavroudis/images/cat.webp">
<p class="text">My biggest passion in life is food and eating,<br> I love food and I enjoy tasting different dishes and exploring the world through the culinary.<br> Consequently, I enjoy cooking since it had my interest from a young age,<br> which I do in my free time (and when I want to eat,of course).
    <br>

    <br>
Being a huge cat-person myself,<br>I have multiple cats in my backyard and one kitty as a pet!<br> Her name is Eevie(like the Pokemon)and she was a stray that we found in our backyard and took in our home as a little kitten.<br> Apart from sleeping, eating, biting and scratching me , she doesn't do much around the house,<br> and just like every ginger cat, She is possessed by a demon.</p>
<br>
<p class="text"> I enjoy listening to music whenever I can. My favourite artists include Arca, Grimes, Crystal Castles,Ethel Cain<br> and Eartheater.My favorite genre of music is Experimental.</p>
    <p class="text"> I used to do a variety of martial arts, like ju jitsu, pagkration, combat ju jitsu, boxing and kickboxing,<br> but stopped because i simply got tired of them and i did not have much free time</p>
